This blog exists because I was about to fall asleep and had a realization: I'm never going to set up WordPress. I'm never going to build a custom blog app. Life is too short, and I'd rather ship things than configure things.

So here's the experiment: **what if blogging was just talking?**

## The Setup

I opened Claude Code in a Git repo at midnight and said something like:

> "Set up a blog where I can just talk to you and you publish it. No branches, no PRs, no friction. Just brain dump to web."

And Claude did it. You're reading the result.

## How It Works

1. I talk to Claude Code in this repo
2. I say "publish this" (or something like that)
3. Claude formats the conversation into a proper Markdown post
4. Commits and pushes to main
5. GitHub Actions builds and deploys to GitHub Pages

That's it. Zero friction. Pure dictation-to-web pipeline.

## Why This Matters

Most developers I know have the same problem: we have thoughts worth sharing, tools worth bragging about, opinions worth debating. But the activation energy to actually blog is too high. By the time you've set up your static site generator, picked a theme, configured your build pipeline, and written your first "Hello World" post... you've lost the spark.

This approach inverts that. The blog infrastructure is invisible. I just talk.

## What You'll Find Here

- Developer tools and workflows that I actually use
- Thoughts on software development, AI, and the craft
- Random screenshots of things I'm building
- Unfiltered brain dumps at midnight

No editorial calendar. No SEO optimization. No drafts rotting in a folder somewhere. Just shipping.

## The Meta Bit

This very post was created by Claude interpreting a conversation where I rambled about wanting a zero-friction blog while fighting sleep. Claude extracted the interesting bits, formatted them, added some structure, and published.

If that's not the future of content creation, I don't know what is.
